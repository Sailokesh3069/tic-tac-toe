Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
Players take turns choosing a position to place their mark. For example, if Player X chooses position 1,The game continues until one player wins or the board is full. It's a simple yet strategic game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages!
